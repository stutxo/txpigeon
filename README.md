connects to a random node from a bitcoin dns seed and broadcasts a transaction

setup for testnet only, conects to these seeds - 

 testnet-seed.bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch, seed.tbtc.petertodd.org, seed.testnet.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl,testnet-seed.bluematt.me
 
 This is just a random project to help learn how to interact with the bitcoin protocol. It is in no way finished, i am currently working on a new version which will use asynchronous networking to connect to multiple nodes and broadcast the transaction at the same time, over TOR.
